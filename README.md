# Ogwel Eugene's Personal Portfolio 

This project is my personal portfolio website, created as a submission for the **PLP Academy's July 2025 Cohort Hackathon 1: Portfolio Challenge**. It's designed to showcase my skills, background, projects, and interests to potential employers and collaborators.
