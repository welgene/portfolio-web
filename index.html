        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Ogwel Eugene — a front-developer and computer science student based in Nairobi, Kenya. 
          Some of the projects i have worked include <a href="#project1">Doxa Photography</a>, <a href="#project2">Contacts</a>.
           I’m passionate about clean code, scalable architecture, and user-centric design. 
           I believe in building products that are fast, accessible, and delightful to use.

           Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do include:
              Comunity Service,Hiking,playing chess and making new friends.
